## 📝 Description

This project is part of the Python3 course by Codecademy, designed to help learners understand the basics of Python programming: Control Flow.

In this project, I built a Magic 8-Ball using control flow in Python. The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune in response to a "Yes" or "No" question possed by the user.
